# Kanban - Project Management

**Break down** EVERYTHING you need to do for **your project into actionable tasks** using [Trello](http://trello.com) \(or whatever you are using for project management\) or All actionable tasks should start with a verb \(i.e. write, call, email, build, collect, etc.\).

Initially, feel free to use something like post-its or lists - but once it is relatively stable, move it to a digital tool like Trello. 

The columns I recommend for Kanban \(but you are not limited to\) are:

* To-Do
* Today \(Work-In-Progress \(WIP\) limit of 3 to 5 maximum\)
* Waiting For \(OPTIONAL\)
* Done
