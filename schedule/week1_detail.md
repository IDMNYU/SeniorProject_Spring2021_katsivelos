## Class

* Announcements: 
  * **Students** can get free headshots from the [NYU Photo Bureau](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/office-of-the-president/university-relationsandpublicaffairs/public-affairs/photo-bureau.html). I highly recommend that you take advantage of it for your portfolio website and LinkedIn profile. It's a very popular service. You just need to book it \(sometimes weeks\) in advance. The NYU photo bureau is currently moving locations. So they're not taking any appointments until February.
